**Assignment Overview**
With the current pace of the class, it is easy to fall behind or feel like you aren't where you should be. This assignment did a wonderful job of really laying out everything we learned in week 5 and 6 and allowed us the opportunity to directly apply it. 

While I know this isn't a direct representation of the real world, it did allow me to catch up and feel like I have a good grasp on API's and DOM maniupulation.
